# RobotCAD — Release v12.6.4

**Date:** 2026-08-15

## Improvements

- **Set Placement** tools now support `Part::LocalCoordinateSystem` (LCS) objects, not only `PartDesign::CoordinateSystem`.
- **Set Placement** tools now work correctly with links to parts/bodies from **external documents**.
- LCS references from external documents are now handled correctly by **Set Placement** tools.
- The **Set Placement as group** tool now allows selecting **2 LCS in the same robot link** (including grouped selection).
- Added a clear error message when trying to convert a FreeCAD Assembly without any joint.

## Fixes

- Fixed the **Assembly → Robot** converter: previously, an assembly with only one joint did not create a robot joint — conversion now works correctly.
- Fixed `get_child_joints()` in `wb_utils.py` — child joint lookup now uses the correct link name (rare error case).
- Fixed the **Set Placement with hold downstream chain** tool.
